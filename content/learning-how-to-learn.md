A few months ago I attended to a Coursera course: Learning how to learn. They present some theories and techiques not only for learning, but also for creativity and your daily tasks. In this post, I want to show the topics I found more important and hope you can also apply some of them in your daily life.

## Tackle procrastination

We procrastinate about things that make us feel a little uncomfortable. So, when you have to do something you rather not to, your brain looks for a way to stop that uncomfortable feeling by switching your attention to a more pleasant activity. 

Nonprocrastinators put negative thoughts aside, like: Com'on! Just do it! You will feel better once you started. The problem is that we think about the final result, but sometimes it's not easy to accomplish. The first tip is: Focus in the process! Process means the time, habits and actions you need to take to get something done. The product is the result of a task.

For example, you can say to yourself: "I'll just spend 20 minutes working on this".


### Pomodoro

A tool that can help you to focus in the process is the Pomodoro Technique. You may have already heard about that. For those who don't, it was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the early 1980's.

You set a timer (traditionally 25 minutes) to turn off any interruptions, accept the challenge and focus on your task. When the time is off you can take a 5 minutes break. This is your time, give yourself a reward: get a cup of coffee or surf the web. 

After your break, go back to another time of focus. After 4 pomodoros you can have a longer break (15 - 30 minutes)


### Changing habits

Habits have 4 components:
1. Suggestion - This is the trigger for your habit
2. The routine - It's the automatic answer of your brain to the trigger. It's like it turns on the zombie mode.
3. The reward - It's the pleasure component. A habit is created because the reward makes you feel better.
4. Conviction - Habits have power because you believe them.

The tip to change a habit is to change your reaction to the trigger.
1. Find what makes you procrastinate. The suggestions are normally in 4 categories: location, time, how do you feel and reactions.
2. You need to create a plan to avoid your brain to distract with something more pleasure. For example, create a new routine. If the plan doesn't work, adapt it.
3. Reward! Give yourself a reward when tackle the procrastination.
4. You have to believe you can do it. When things get stressed, you may want to go back to old bad habits.
