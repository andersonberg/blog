Today, I want to talk about a course I attended a few months ago at Coursera called "Learning how to learn". It's a four week course where they show some **MENTAL TOOLS** to help you study and memorize stuff. To support that, they show **THEORIES** and to understand how our brain and our memory works. 

I choose some of the tips that I want to share with you today.


## Tackle procrastination

The first rule of thumb is: **AVOID PROCRASTINATION**. Seriously, run of it!

To do that, we need to understand why we procrastinate.

Sometimes you have to study or do something you rather not to. That make you feel  a little **UNCOMFORTABLE** or even **unhappy**. Our brain, as a smart one, tries to stop that feeling by switching your attention to a more **PLEASANT** activity. Then you go to youtube with automatic next video on and when you realize, the afternoon is gone and you... did nothing... that's sad.

It's all a matter of **HABITS**. You need to find the **TRIGGER**, that little thing that makes you procrastinate. Once you find it change the **ROUTINE**.

The book The Power of Habit is a good reading to understand that.


## Focus in the process

When we have to study or have a task done, we usually think about the **final result**. What's the **PRODUCT** of that task... but sometimes it's **NOT EASY** to accomplish and our brain starts to procrastinate again...

The next tip is: Focus in the process! Process means the **TIME, EFFORT AND HABITS** you take to get something done. 

Nonprocrastinators put negative thoughts aside, like: "Com'on! Just do it! You will feel better once you started."
"That's not bad! I'll just spend some minutes doing that."


## Pomodoro

A tool that can help you to focus in the process is the **Pomodoro Technique**. It was developed by **Francesco Cirillo** in the early 1980's.

To start using it, you set a **TIMER** (it can be 25 minutes or the time that works for you). Then you **TURN OFF ANY INTERRUPTIONS**, get rid of any notifications, **ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE** and focus on your task. 

When the time is off you can take a 5 minutes break. This is your time, give yourself a reward: get a cup of coffee or surf the web.

After your break, go back to another time of focus. 

Once you’ve completed 4 pomodoros you can take a **longer break** (15 - 30 minutes). Your brain will use this time to assimilate the new information.


## Chunking

When you are trying to understand a new concept, it sometimes doesn't make sense to you and it's like a bunch of puzzle pieces you can't put together.

Chunking is a mental tool that helps you to **MERGE INFORMATION** through **MEANING**.

Chunks are **PACKS OF INFORMATION** your brain can easily access.

Chunking involves creating something **MORE MEANINGFUL** and it will be more **MEMORABLE**.

For example, if you are trying to memorize a number:
351962752183 becomes 351 96 275 2183
A list of things such as buying figs, lettuce, oranges, apples, and tomatoes. You can create a word out of the first letters (e.g., "FLOAT")


## Example of chunking
A good example of chunking is when you are **LEARNING TO PLAY A SONG**. You start **SPLITTING** the music in some parts (introduction, verse...). Then you **MEMORIZE** some chords and start playing. Then you put those chords **TOGETHER** (you are putting meaning in the intro) and finally you put **ALL THE SONG PARTS TOGETHER** and you have some **MEANING** on that song.


## How can I build a chunk?

Now that I know what a chunk is, how can I help my brain to build a new one?

First step is to **FOCUS** in the information you want to process. The Pomodor Technique can be very helpful here.

Second, you have to **UNDERSTAND the basic idea** of what you are learning. You can do that by doing a quick **WALK THROUGH** a chapter or **GLANCING** at pictures and section headings.

Third step is to know the **CONTEXT**. You understand **HOW AND WHEN** you can use the chunk.

At last, **PRACTICE** and **REPETITION** help you to **CONSOLIDATE** the chunk in you mind and make it more accessible.


## Learn by spaced repetition

Don't let everything you have to learn for one day.

Plan your schedule to study a **LITTLE** about a subject **EVERY DAY**.

Our brain needs rest. At night it cleans some **TOXINS** that can prevent you to think **CLEARLY**.

In spaced learning, your brain will be able to **RETAIN THE INFORMATION** in your long-term memory.

Also, you can use Diffuse mode. Diffuse mode happens when your brain is in a more **RELAX STATE**. Your thoughts are a little vague. The brain will create new connections between the neurons and you learn or understand something new.

It's really useful when you are **LEARNING SOMETHING NEW**, specially if it's a little **HARD**.

For example, they say that this guy, **Salvador Dalí**, had an interesting technique to help creating his paintings. He relaxed in a chair and let his **MIND GO FREE**, vaguely thinking about what he was previously focusing on. He has keys in his hands, dangling a little. When he was almost falling asleep, the noise of the keys on the floor would wake him up and back to the focus mode.

You can find a way that suits you to access your diffuse mode. For me, (when I'm stucked in something I need to learn, or even in a **CODE PROBLEM** I have to solve) I go for a **WALK** or **TAKE A SHOWER** and the time I'm back, I can figure out the problem.


## General tips

If you are reading a book, try to **REMEMBER what you just learn**. Not just read and **HIGHLIGHT** the important parts of a chapter. **EXPLAIN YOURSELF OR A FRIEND** what you read and learn.

Make a **TEST TO IMPROVE YOUR KNOWLEDGE**. It's good to remember and review some points.

Learn how to use metaphors and analogies to give more meaning to what you learning. It's even better if you can **INVOLVE MORE THAN ONE SENSE** (e.g.: hearing and vision).

Exercises can **IMPROVE** our memory and ability to learn.



### Changing habits

Habits have 4 components:
1. Suggestion - This is the trigger for your habit
2. The routine - It's the automatic answer of your brain to the trigger. It's like it turns on the zombie mode.
3. The reward - It's the pleasure component. A habit is created because the reward makes you feel better.
4. Conviction - Habits have power because you believe them.

The tip to change a habit is to change your reaction to the trigger.
1. Find what makes you procrastinate. The suggestions are normally in 4 categories: location, time, how do you feel and reactions.
2. You need to create a plan to avoid your brain to distract with something more pleasure. For example, create a new routine. If the plan doesn't work at first, adjust it.
3. Reward! Give yourself a reward when win the battle against procrastination.
4. You have to believe you can do it. When things get stressed, you may want to go back to old bad habits.
