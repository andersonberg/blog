A few months ago I attended a course at Coursera called "Learning how to learn". They show some theories and techiques to understand how our brain and memory works. Their tips are good not only for learning, but also for creativity and our daily tasks. In this post, I want to show the topics I found more important and hope you can also apply some of them in your daily life. 

## Tackle procrastination

The most important tip is to avoid procrastination.

We often procrastinate about things that make us feel a little **uncomfortable** or **unhappy**. When you have to do something you rather not to, your brain looks for a way to stop that feeling by switching your attention to a more **pleasant** activity. 

Nonprocrastinators put negative thoughts aside, like: Com'on! Just do it! You will feel better once you started. The problem is that we think about the **final result**, but sometimes it's not easy to accomplish. 

The first tip is: **Focus in the process!** Process means the time, habits and actions you need to take to get something done. The product is the result of a task.

For example, you can say to yourself: "I'll just spend 20 minutes working on this task". Over: "I need this project done."
Instead you say: "I need to learn XYZ", you say: "I'll study XYZ for an hour starting by Y"


### Pomodoro

A tool that can help you to focus in the process is the Pomodoro Technique. You may have already heard about that. For those who don't, it was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the early 1980's.

You set a timer (traditionally 25 minutes) to turn off any interruptions, accept the challenge and focus on your task. When the time is off you can take a 5 minutes break. This is your time, give yourself a reward: get a cup of coffee or surf the web. 

After your break, go back to another time of focus. After 4 pomodoros you can have a longer break (15 - 30 minutes)


## Chunking

Chunking is a process that our brain uses to organize memories in modules. For example, when you have to memorize a phone number, you organize the algarisms in small groups.

Chunks can help you to understand new concepts, because when your brain builds a chunk you can find out that a chunk may be related to other similar chunk, even from completely different fields.


### How can I build a chunk?

First step is to FOCUS in the information you want to process.
Second, is to UNDERSTAND the basic idea of what you are learning.
Third step of the process of create a chunk is to know the CONTEXT. That way you can learn both how and when use the chunk.
At last, PRACTICE helps you to expand the neural network, allowing you to consolidate the chunk and make it more accessible.


## General tips

Try to remember what you just learn from a book. Not just read and highlight the important parts of a chapter. Explain yourself or a friend what you read and learn.

Make a test to improve your knowledge. It's good to remember and review some points.

Exercises can improve our memory and ability to learn. That are better than any drugs.

Learn how to use metaphors and analogies to give more meaning to what you learning. It's even better if you can involve more than one sense (e.g.: hearing and vision).


## Learn by spaced repetition
Plan your schedule to study a little about a subject every day, rather than hurry to learn everything in one day. 
Our brain needs rest. At night it cleans toxins that can prevent you to think clearly.
In spaced learning, your brain will be able to retain the information in your long-term memory.


## Difuse mode



### Changing habits

Habits have 4 components:
1. Suggestion - This is the trigger for your habit
2. The routine - It's the automatic answer of your brain to the trigger. It's like it turns on the zombie mode.
3. The reward - It's the pleasure component. A habit is created because the reward makes you feel better.
4. Conviction - Habits have power because you believe them.

The tip to change a habit is to change your reaction to the trigger.
1. Find what makes you procrastinate. The suggestions are normally in 4 categories: location, time, how do you feel and reactions.
2. You need to create a plan to avoid your brain to distract with something more pleasure. For example, create a new routine. If the plan doesn't work at first, adjust it.
3. Reward! Give yourself a reward when win the battle against procrastination.
4. You have to believe you can do it. When things get stressed, you may want to go back to old bad habits.
