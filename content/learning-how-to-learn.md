A few months ago I attended a course at Coursera called "Learning how to learn". They show some **MENTAL TOOLS** to help you study and memorize stuff. Also, they show **THEORIES** and **TECHIQUES** to understand how our brain and memory works.

I found their tips useful not only for learning, but I also for **CREATIVITY** and **DAILY TASKS**. 

In this presentation, I want to show the topics I found more important and hope you can also apply some of them in your daily life. 

## Tackle procrastination

The most important tip is to **AVOID PROCRASTINATION**.

We often procrastinate about things that make us feel a little **UNCOMFORTABLE** or **unhappy**. When you have to do something you rather not to, your brain looks for a way to stop that feeling by switching your attention to a more **PLEASANT** activity. 

It's a matter of **HABITS**. You need to find the **TRIGGER** that makes you procrastinate and change the **ROUTINE**.

The first tip is: **Focus in the process!** Process means the time, habits and actions you need to take to get something done. 

Nonprocrastinators put negative thoughts aside, like: Com'on! Just do it! You will feel better once you started.

The problem is that we think about the **final result**, but sometimes it's **NOT EASY** to accomplish. 



### Pomodoro

A tool that can help you to focus in the process is the **Pomodoro Technique**. You may have already heard about that. For those who don't, it was developed by **Francesco Cirillo** in the early 1980's.

You set a **TIMER** (traditionally 25 minutes) to **TURN OFF ANY INTERRUPTIONS**, accept the challenge and focus on your task. When the time is off you can take a 5 minutes break. This is your time, give yourself a reward: get a cup of coffee or surf the web.

After your break, go back to another time of focus. After 4 pomodoros you can have a **longer break** (15 - 30 minutes)


## Chunking

Chunks are **PACKS OF INFORMATION** your brain can easily access.

Chunking is a mental tool that helps you to **MERGE INFORMATION** through **MEANING**. Like puzzle pieces.

Chunking involves creating something **MORE MEANINGFUL** and it will be more **MEMORABLE**.

For example, if you are trying to memorize a number:
351962752183 becomes 351 96 275 2183
A list of things such as buying figs, lettuce, oranges, apples, and tomatoes. You can create a word out of the first letters (e.g., "FLOAT")


### How can I build a chunk?

First step is to **FOCUS** in the information you want to process.

Second, is to **UNDERSTAND the basic idea** of what you are learning. You can do that by doing a rapid picture **WALK THROUGH** a chapter. **GLANCING** at pictures and section headings.

Third step of the process of create a chunk is to know the **CONTEXT**. That way you can learn both **HOW AND WHEN** use the chunk.

At last, **PRACTICE** helps you to expand the neural network, allowing you to **CONSOLIDATE** the chunk and make it more accessible.


## Learn by spaced repetition

Plan your schedule to study a **LITTLE** about a subject **EVERY DAY**, rather than hurry to learn everything in one day. 

Our brain needs rest. At night it cleans toxins that can prevent you to think **CLEARLY**.

In spaced learning, your brain will be able to **RETAIN THE INFORMATION** in your long-term memory.

Diffuse mode happens when your brain is in a more **RELAX STATE**. So you let your thoughts be a little vague, it creates new connections between the neurons and you learn or understand something new.

It's really useful when you are **LEARNING SOMETHING NEW**, specially if it's a little **HARD**.

For example, they say Salvador Dalí had an interesting technique. He relaxed in a chair and let his mind go free, vaguely thinking about what he was focusing on. He has keys in his hands, dangling a little. When he was almost falling asleep, the noise of the keys on the floor would wake him up and back to the focus mode.

For me, (when I'm stucked in something I need to learn, or even in a **CODE PROBLEM** I have to solve) I go for a **WALK** or **TAKE A SHOWER** and the time I'm back, I can figure out the problem.


## General tips

If you are reading a book, try to **REMEMBER what you just learn**. Not just read and **HIGHLIGHT** the important parts of a chapter. **EXPLAIN YOURSELF OR A FRIEND** what you read and learn.

Make a **TEST TO IMPROVE YOUR KNOWLEDGE**. It's good to remember and review some points.

Learn how to use metaphors and analogies to give more meaning to what you learning. It's even better if you can **INVOLVE MORE THAN ONE SENSE** (e.g.: hearing and vision).

Exercises can **IMPROVE** our memory and ability to learn. **They are better than any drugs.**



### Changing habits

Habits have 4 components:
1. Suggestion - This is the trigger for your habit
2. The routine - It's the automatic answer of your brain to the trigger. It's like it turns on the zombie mode.
3. The reward - It's the pleasure component. A habit is created because the reward makes you feel better.
4. Conviction - Habits have power because you believe them.

The tip to change a habit is to change your reaction to the trigger.
1. Find what makes you procrastinate. The suggestions are normally in 4 categories: location, time, how do you feel and reactions.
2. You need to create a plan to avoid your brain to distract with something more pleasure. For example, create a new routine. If the plan doesn't work at first, adjust it.
3. Reward! Give yourself a reward when win the battle against procrastination.
4. You have to believe you can do it. When things get stressed, you may want to go back to old bad habits.
